# Charge-calculator-using-Simpsons-s-One-third-rule
 From the Simpsonâ€™s 1/3rd rule, we can calculate the charge by integrating current across a given time interval and getting the output. From this we can calculate any amount charge produced by any current. We can calculate charges for large time interval as well as very small time intervals by proper choosing of step size.
