# Charge-calculator-using-Simpsons-s-One-third-rule
 From the Simpson’s 1/3rd rule, we can calculate the charge by integrating current across a given time interval and getting the output. From this we can calculate any amount charge produced by any current. We can calculate charges for large time interval as well as very small time intervals by proper choosing of step size. 
Any time varying function you want to integrate you can use. Just change the return function in function definition. Choose the step function(h) accordingly. 
Electric charge is a physical quantity that causes it to experience force when placed in an electromagnetic field. It is also quantified as current times time. 
Q=I*t 
Where Q= charge 
I=current, t=time. 
When an instantaneous value of current is given then  
Q= ∫Idt
